        "✅ There are many types of regression methods, and which one you pick depends on the answer you're looking for. If you want to predict the probable height for a person of a given age, you'd use `linear regression`, as you're seeking a **numeric value**. If you're interested in discovering whether a type of cuisine should be considered vegan or not, you're looking for a **category assignment** so you would use `logistic regression`. You'll learn more about logistic regression later. Think a bit about some questions you can ask of data, and which of these methods would be more appropriate.\n",

        "In this section, you will work with a [small dataset about diabetes](https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~boos/var.select/diabetes.html). Imagine that you wanted to test a treatment for diabetic patients. Machine Learning models might help you determine which patients would respond better to the treatment, based on combinations of variables. Even a very basic regression model, when visualized, might show information about variables that would help you organize your theoretical clinical trials.\n",
